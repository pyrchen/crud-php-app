# Manao Task

## Client

Create my custom Executor class for registration the logic on the frontend part.
Maybe this way isn't appropriate for such the app, but I started developing in this OOP
style and finished in the same one.

## Backend (PHP)

Create Router class to handle all necessary RESTAPI requests. Also split the logic into smaller parts, such
as: Services, Routers, Dto, Middlewares, Models and etc.

## Final

(I don't like my client code, but it's better than write everything from scratch)
I spent a lot of time on PHP code, but it looks not so good as I wanted :)

The app wasn't deployed to cloud services. There's a need to clone this repository :(

Thanks for reading!
